# Sun-and-Moon-Tarot
The Sun and Soon tarot app was developed for my significant other as she loves Tarot readings but does not always have the space or time to do so. This app allows users to do various Tarot readings with a variety of designs. After each reading, the reading type as well as the cards are saved under the "History" tab to go back to any previous reading that was done. This history will attempt to sync over iCloud and if it cannot it will automatically save the data locally.

This application is still in development and has a few things that will need continued work. The next steps of the project are listed below:

1. Developing a full 'Settings' page with the included features:
  - Ability to change background to a variety of colors based on light or dark mode.
  - Text size adjust
  - A restore in app purchases option (if synced via iCloud)
  - Verison information
  - Hyperlinked review

2. Readings tab:
  - Finalize the current readings that are included
  - Add animations for readings

3. Card storage:
  - Adding card descriptions
  - Adding additional art (possibly a community store if applicable down the line)

4. Over all UI:
  - Additional changes and advancments to the current UI
